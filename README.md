# tfmigrate-storage

This repository maintained the storage implementation of tfmigrate for a while. Initially, this repository was distributed under the MPL2 license with the intention of reusing code fragments from terraform's backend implementation, but this actually did not happen, so we finally reverted to MIT and merged this repository into the [tfmigrate](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfmigrate) repository. For details, see https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfmigrate/issues/146.
